I tried to give Phenomenon another shot for getting a simple fragment shader going.
I think I got closer this time, but it's still not working.
REGL is still more ergonomic though.
Phenomonen is pretty unforgiving when it comes to not giving it exactly what it expects or getting something wrong,
I had to dig into the library code to actually figure out where I was going wrong just to get this far.

## Running

You can run this with

```
npm start
```

but it doesn't work at the moment.
